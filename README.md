# numbersort
This project provides utility code to load a given file containing integers, sort, and then write sorted list to an output file. This is part of testing I am doing to compare language performance. I have added similar projects for rust and java.

To compile the project run

```stack build```

To run:

```stack exec numsort-exe /tmp/10000000.random```
